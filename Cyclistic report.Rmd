## ASK

The problem to be solved is, \### How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently? The bussiness task is, \### Maximizing the number of annual memberships The stake holders are \### a. Cyclistic executive team \### b. Cyclistic marketing analytics team \### c. Lily Moreno

Where is your data located? Index of bucket "divvy-tripdata"

● How is the data organized? There were 12 datasets, each having 13 columns and several thousand rows

● Are there issues with bias or credibility in this data? Does your data ROCCC? There are no issues with credibility or bias. The data is reliable, original as it can be validated by the source link, it is comprehensive as it has all the required information needed for the analysis. Also, it is current as it provides data monthly up to last month and it is cited by Motivate international inc

● How are you addressing licensing, privacy, security, and accessibility? The data is private as it does not contain any personal identifiable information. It is also licensed which can be verified in this site Data License Agreement \| Divvy Bikes where details about licensing, privacy, security, and accessibility can be seen.

● How did you verify the data's integrity? I verified my data by researching about the data source and divvy bike is a credible organization.

● How does it help you answer your question? The data help me see the various relationships between member and casual riders. I am able to study their activities and draw conclusions based on my findings

● Are there any problems with the data? There are inconsistency in some columns and some missing fields which would be handled in the process phase

## PREPARE

We first of all load our dataset and rename them

```{r}
tripdata_1 <- read_csv("divvy/divvy_tripdata/202110-divvy-tripdata.csv")
tripdata_2 <- read_csv("divvy/divvy_tripdata/202111-divvy-tripdata.csv") 
tripdata_3 <- read_csv("divvy/divvy_tripdata/202112-divvy-tripdata.csv")

tripdata_12 <- read_csv("divvy/divvy_tripdata/202209-divvy-publictripdata.csv")

 # Using the report in the console after running this code chunk, we can see the columns are consistent having this 
 # chr  (7): ride_id, rideable_type, start_station_name, start_station_id, end_station...

#ACT
#INSIGHTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Following my analysis, this were my conclusions
1.The casual riders have two times more average ride duration. The max ride duration is also three times more for the casual riders.

2.The member riders has more number of trips however the mean ride length is longer for casual riders.

3.The mean ride duration was roughly around 1200-1700 secs and it was highest from saturday to monday while casual riders had 709-843 secs as average ride duration and it peaks on weekends

4.Regarding rideable type , the classic bike was preferred by both users and the docked bike was used only by the casual riders.The number of trips were higher for members.

5.The busiest month for both users were from june to august


#recommendation
1.Promotions should be run showing that it is cheaper on the long run to be a member

2.Give incentives/bonuses to riders who are members for raching a certain ride duration

3.Promotions and awareness campaign should be more from may to august as this period has the highest ride activities
